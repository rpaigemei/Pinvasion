### Creative Project 3: Culture Jamming

**Pinvasion**

Pinvasion is a game where players try to preserve the authenticity of a Pinterest-style feed by removing the invasive ads. As ads multiply and scroll faster each wave, players must keep the feed “alive” in a platform where commercial content is quietly taking over. It mimics the recognizable aesthetic of Pinterest to critique the growing amount of ads present in popular social media platforms and how they seamlessly blend into the feeds.

The game was developed in React.js, using React hooks to implement the game mechanics. It is deployed through Netlify, making it a web browser game. The images used in the posts are fetched from the Lorem Picsum API.
